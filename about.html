							“To create a better everyday life for the many people”, this is
							the MEA&KAI vision. Our business idea is “to offer a wide range of
							well-designed, functional home furnishing products at prices so
							low that as many people as possible will be able to afford them”.
							<br />
							<br />
							We work hard to achieve quality at affordable prices for our
							customers through optimising our entire value chain, by building
							long-term supplier relationships, investing in highly automated
							production and producing large volumes. Our vision also goes
							beyond home furnishing. We want to create a better everyday for
							all people impacted by our business.

							“At MEA&KAI, we believe we can improve people's lives through
							business. Founded in 2006, we understand the imperative for our
							company to operate responsibly and know that you want to buy from
							a company that works hard to integrate sustainable and responsible
							practices into all that they do. Our efforts are focused on making
							sure that we operate in a manner that's consistent with our brand
							values. We'll continue to travel this path and communicate with
							you along the journey.” <br />
							<br />

							MEA&KAI was founded to help provide shoes for children in need,
							and over the years, they’ve embraced numerous other charitable
							causes as well. While the specific need they’re addressing isn’t
							explicitly stated in the Corporate Responsibility excerpt above,
							it is the focus of their company story.
							<br />
							<br />
							The values they support are sustainable and responsible practices
							for both business and community, both of which they introduce in
							the excerpt above. MEA&KAI's sacrifices revenue for those values
							by giving away products and choosing ethically sourced materials,
							suppliers and vendors.
							<br />
							<br />
							Operating in alignment with their values is central to their
							mission, and their focus on fostering community brings people into
							their mission as well. They highlight their commitment to
							customers by speaking to them directly in the second person
							throughout their mission statement.

							In 1887, John W. Nordstrom, at 16 years old, left Sweden for the
							United States. He arrived in New York with $5 in his pocket,
							unable to speak a word of English. <br />
							<br />
							The young immigrant labored in mines and logging camps as he
							crossed the country to California and Washington. In 1897, he
							headed north to Alaska and the Klondike in search of gold. Two
							years later, he returned to Seattle with a $13,000 stake, ready to
							settle down.
							<br />
							<br />
							Carl F. Wallin, a Seattle shoemaker Nordstrom had met in Alaska,
							offered him a partnership in a shoe store. In 1901, they opened
							their first store, Wallin & Nordstrom, on Fourth and Pike in
							Seattle.
							<br />
							<br />
							The business grew and, in 1923, the partners added a second store
							in Seattle's University District.
							<br />
							<br />
							In 1928, John retired and sold his share of the company to his
							sons Everett and Elmer. Carl Wallin retired a year later and also
							sold his share to the Nordstrom sons. John's third son, Lloyd,
							joined the team in 1933.
